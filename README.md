<h1>VM Creation and Connection Lab(Azure)</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Welcome to my virtual lab, where we're discovering Microsoft Azure together. In this lab, we're learning how to create virtual machines using Azure and connect to them using Remote Desktop. It's an exciting journey into the world of IT, join me as we build our IT skills, one step at a time. It's a beginner-friendly space, so don't hesitate to jump in and start learning with me!
<br />


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Microsoft Azure</b> 
- <b>Remote Desktop Connection</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10</b> (21H2)
- <b>Ubuntu<b> (x64 Gen2)

First Step On Creating Your VMüë®‚Äçüíª
 
<p>
Once you login into your azure account, you will go to the icon "virtual machine" and press create.

Pick the subscription you are using for the lab, and then either choose an existing reasource group or create a new one. Next you will name your VM, in my case I named it VM1. You can use any region, but just for me it worked best when I used US West 3. Since we are making two different virtual machines, my first one will be Windows 10 with VM architecture x64. When choosing the size it just depends on how fast you want your VM to be, certain ones will require more cpus, but in my case 2cpus with 16 GiB memory worked perfectly fine. After this it will have you make a username and password for your VM (DO NOT FORGET THIS!!) so that you can login and in later projects, so that you can read the traffic using these items. Allow select ports and makes sure the inbound port is RDP (3389) and check the box. After this we will hit the next/disk then go next to networking where it'll create a subnet and an IP address for our Windows VM, click create where it'll validate it and the click create one more time.
